# Temp-aarch64-chroot-for-nheko-compile-issues-in-qemu
Temporary aarch64 chroot for debugging nheko compile issues in qemu-aarch64-static

Note:
All code contained in this chroot is from projects with open source licenses. I believe that gives me the permission to distribute them in this form (a chroot archvie with some source code that fails to compile) for the sole purpose of debugging an issue in QEMU.
